The top plot shows the average for each hour of the day, across the timeframe selected –
providing an idea of daily PM2.5 trends reflected by the selected sensor.

    Below the plot, the table of weather data (left) and the pollution rose (right) can provide additional useful information. For example, a high humidity value may be an indication that a precipitation event occurred, while the pollution rose can illustrate the direction the wind was blowing from, when high or low PM2.5 levels were observed – possibly providing some insight into potential sources.
