    Select a sensor to compare to the nearest reference site by clicking on the map or by using the drop down menus in the
panel on the left, then select a timeframe using the ‘Date’ and ‘View Past’ options.

  The plots below the map illustrate how well the sensor and nearest reference site (with continuous PM2.5) agree with each
other (in the ‘Sensor-Monitor Correlation’ plot) and how the trends between the sensor and the reference site compare
(in the ‘Sensor-Monitor Comparison’ plot). Note the distance between the reference site location and the sensor location
by viewing the map and stated difference in the Title of the Sensor-Monitor Comparison plot.

    In terms of the statistics, a slope close to 1.0 indicates that the low-cost sensor and the reference site are reflecting similar
levels. A slope greater than 1.0 indicates that higher values are seen at the regulatory monitoring site and vice versa for a
slope of less than 1.0. The intercept can be an indicator of bias. The coefficient of determination R2 tells us how well the
trends agree between the two sites; an R2 closer to 1.0 indicates more agreement and an R2 closer to 0.0 indicates less
agreement.

    The sensor status table provides insight into how well the sensor is functioning. For example, if the percent of data
recovered is small, then this may be an indication of a performance issue with the sensor.
