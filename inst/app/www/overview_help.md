#### Overview Help

Select a sensor by clicking on the map or by using the drop down menus. 
After selecting a sensor, the plot below the map will display the hourly averages 
for the date range selected.

Change the date range by selecting an interval on the calendar. 

Take a closer look at the data in the plot by using the mouse to highlight the 
hour of interest. You can zoom by click-dragging a horizontal window across the 
chart, and reset your zoom by double-clickin anywhere within the chart.

Note: The PM2.5 values displayed on the map are the average PM2.5 levels for the 
same time frame displayed in the plot.

The colors in the map and in the plot correspond to different levels of PM2.5. The
scale is provided in the About page and shows which colors correspond to which
concentration ranges.
