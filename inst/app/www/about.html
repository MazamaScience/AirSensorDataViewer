<h3>Description and Intended Purpose:</h3>
<p>
The AirSensor DataViewer as well as the AirSensor R-Package were developed through a collaboration between the AQ-SPEC group at the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), a regional U.S. Governmental Agency in California, USA and Mazama Science, a software company in Seattle, WA. This tool is intended to support data exploration and analysis by community members participating in the US EPA funded Science To Achieve Results (STAR) Grant at the South Coast AQMD, entitled “Engage, Educate and Empower California Communities on the Use and Applications of Low-cost Air Monitoring Sensors”. A white-paper is avaliable: <a href = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104832>The AirSensor open-source R-package and DataViewer web application for interpreting community data collected by low-cost sensor networks.</a>
Funding for the development of this tool was provided through the above mentioned US EPA STAR Grant.

<h3>Description of QA/QC Procedures:</h3>
<p>
  All data provided throughout this application (with the exception of the data displayed on the “Raw Data” tab on the Explorer page and the data shown on the “Latest Data” page) has undergone the following QA/QC procedures: (1) removal of values outside of the specifications for the sensors, as defined by the manufacturer, (2) pollutant values for Channel A and Channel B are averaged on an hourly basis, (3) if the proportion of points contributing to the hourly average meets the minimum requirement and the hourly averages are judged to be not statistically different, according to a student’s t-test, then the hourly averages for Channel A and B are averaged together – producing a single value for each hour. More detail on the procedures and functions used is available in the AirSensor R-Package documentation.
