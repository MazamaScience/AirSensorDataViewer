#### Raw Data Help

Select a sensor using the drop down menus in the panel on the left. 

Select a timeframe using the ‘Date’ and ‘View Past’ options.

The plots in this tab show the “raw data” (or data that comes directly from the sensor, without any time averaging applied); included are the PM2.5 signals from the duplicate sensors in eachPurpleAir sensor (Channel A and B) as well as the temperature and humidity signals.

Below the time series plots are two more plots that illustrate how well the two PM2.5 signals (from Channel A and B) agree with each other – significant differences between the channels may be an indication that either one or both of the duplicate sensors is malfunctioning (agreement is signified by a ‘Slope’ close to 1.00 and a high R2, also close to 1.00).
