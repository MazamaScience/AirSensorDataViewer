### Daily Patterns Help 

Select a sensor using the drop down menus in the panel on the left.

Select a time frame using the 'Date Range' selection.
 
The top plot shows the average for each hour of the day, across the time 
frame selected – providing an idea of daily PM2.5 trends reflected by the selected sensor.

Below the plot, the table of weather data (left) and the pollution rose (right) 
can provide additional useful information. For example, a high humidity value 
may be an indication that a precipitation event occurred, while the pollution 
rose can illustrate the direction the wind was blowing from, when high or low 
PM2.5 levels were observed – possibly providing some insight into potential sources.

Note that the weather data is provided via closest data available from NOAA’s 
Integrated Surface Database (ISD).
